IMPORTANT SETUP INSTRUCTIONS:
=============================

1. Go to Firebase Console (https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select your JobTracker project
3. Click "Firestore Database" in the left sidebar
4. Click the "Rules" tab
5. Replace the existing rules with the rules above
6. Click "Publish" 
7. Wait 1-2 minutes for the rules to propagate

SECURITY EXPLANATION:
====================

These rules ensure that:
- Users can only access their own data (users/{userId}/...)
- Authentication is required for all operations
- No user can read or modify another user's job data
- The structure follows: users/{userId}/jobs/{jobId}

TESTING THE RULES:
==================

After updating the rules, test them by:
1. Opening browser console on your JobTracker app
2. Running: testFirestoreAccess('your-user-id')
3. Should return success without permission errors

TROUBLESHOOTING:
===============

If you still get permission errors:
1. Make sure you're signed in to the app
2. Check that your user ID matches the Firestore path
3. Wait a few minutes for rules to propagate
4. Try refreshing the page and signing in again
5. Check Firebase Console → Authentication to see if user exists
